 - ##### [See documentation](https://github.com/specowos/Luna#lusr "See documentation")

## Description
##### Luna is a module based ui library made with [clutter](https://github.com/0zBug/Clutter "clutter"), a project my friend made which is a roact alternative with flutter based syntax.


## Modules
#### Luna notification module (Luno)
- ##### While still in progress, luno will be useful notification module to replace roblox's old and buggy notification serverice using setcore. 
- ##### Luno has more options and more modern styles.

#### Luna user module (Lusr)
- ##### In-development

## Progress
##### Luno is being worked on and has had 2 mock-ups and will be made in clutter at some point or another.

## Documentation
### Luno
- #### Luno can be used pretty easily with only 1 function.
 - ##### Making a simple notification
 ```lua
--// Luno notification loadstring
Lotify("Notification title", "Notification description", "Defualt", 1, "Light")
```
- ##### The first 2 variables are self describing but the others are important
- ##### The 3rd variable is used to describe the image, use `"Defualt"` if you want the standard moon and use `"None"` for no image.
- ##### The 4th variable is used to select the style, there are 3 styles.
#### Styles
 - ##### `1` The 1st style is just the classic type style, nothing too crazy.
 - ##### `2` The 2nd style is more based off of a [orion](https://github.com/shlexware/Orion "orion") design.
 - ##### `3` The 3rd design is my own style called rocket, a modern and interesting design not truly based off anything.
 
- ##### The 5th variable is the theme, use `"Light"` for a light theme and `"Dark"` for a dark theme. Custom theming will most likely be possible soon.
 
### Lusr
- #### Work in progress
